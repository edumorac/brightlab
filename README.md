I designed and developed this website back in 2016 using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
I recently made some minor revisions to the project. The idea was to simply display Brightlab's goals and story, as well as showcase the Kickstarter campaign. 
This is the link to the Kickstarter campaign: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brightlab/spanish-for-travelers-a-learning-journal/description?token=272e154f
